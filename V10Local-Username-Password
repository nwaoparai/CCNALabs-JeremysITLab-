1. Use PC1 to access R1 via the console port.

2. Create the following users on R1:
    username: ccna  /  password: cisco
   username: ccnp  /  password: CISCO

3. Configure the console line to use the local user database to authenticate users.

4. Logout of the router, and login again with each account.  Are the passwords case-sensitive?

5. Create a third user on R1:
   username: CCNA  /  password: router

6. Login to the router with the CCNA account.  Then logout and try to login with the ccna account.  Which password do you have to use?  Check the running-config to confirm the situation.

7. Review: Are usernames case-sensitive?  Are passwords case-sensitive?
