1. Configure the G0/0 and G0/1 interfaces of R1 and R2 according to the network diagram, and enable the interfaces.

2. From PC1 ping R1's G0/1 interface, R1's G0/0 interface, R2's G0/0 interface, R2's G0/1 interface, then PC2.  Which pings succeed?  Which pings fail?

3. Similarly, ping from PC2 to R2's G0/1 interface, then progressively ping toward PC1.  Which pings succeed?  Which pings fail?

 4. Configure static routes on R1 and R2 to allow PC1 to reach PC2, and vice versa.
     Configure the routes to the subnets the PCs are part of, not directly to the PCs.  
     Test by using ping or tracert from each PC.
